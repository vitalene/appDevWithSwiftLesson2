 ## Exercise: What Fits on your iPhone?
 
 In this exercise youâ€™re going to work on a calculation dear to all our hearts: how much stuff can I fit on my iPhone?
 
 Unlike the previous exercises, no code will be provided. You can do it!
 
 
 - iPhone storage capacity is measured in **gigabytes** (GB).
 - The iPhone in question has 8GB of storage.
 - A gigabyte is **1000 megabytes** (MB)
 - The phone already has **3GB** of stuff on it
 - **1 minute** of video takes **150MB** of space
 
 - experiment: How many minutes of video will it take to fill the phone?
 
 _Hint_: Do all of your calculations in megabytes.
*/
let totalStorageSpace = 8
let megabytesInAGigabyte = 1000
let aMinuteOfVideo = 150
let alreadyTakenSpace = 3
let spaceBeforeVideo = (totalStorageSpace - alreadyTakenSpace) * megabytesInAGigabyte
let howManyMinutes = spaceBeforeVideo / aMinuteOfVideo
