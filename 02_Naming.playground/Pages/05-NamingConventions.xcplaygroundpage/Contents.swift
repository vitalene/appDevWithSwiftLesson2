//: ## Naming
//: In Swift, names start with a lower case letter. A name can also be a few different words all run together, like in the examples below.
//:
//: You can‚Äôt separate the words with a space because Swift will think each word is a different name. When the name is a bunch of words all run together, the first word should be entirely lowercase, the first letter of the remaining words should be capitalized, like in the examples below. This makes the name easier to read.
//: - note: This way of writing out names is called _camel case_ because the capital letters in the middle of the name look a bit like the humps of a camel. üê´
let numberOfDogs = 6 + 2

let numberOfPotBelliedPigs = 1

let numberOfFish = 1

let numberOfSnakes = 1

let numberOfCats = 5 - 1

let numberOfTurtles = 2 + 1

let numberOfHamsters = 1 + 1

let totalNumberOfAnimals = numberOfDogs + numberOfCats + numberOfTurtles + numberOfHamsters + numberOfPotBelliedPigs + numberOfFish + numberOfSnakes 

let totalNumberOfMammals = numberOfDogs + numberOfCats + numberOfHamsters + numberOfPotBelliedPigs


//: - experiment: There are even more changes in what pets will be at the pet show.\
//:To add new kinds of animals, add new lines of code defining new names.\
//:Note: To add a new line of code just click on a blank line in the area above and start typing.
//:
//: Please make the following additions:
//: - Someone is bringing a pot-bellied pig (a mammal)
//: - Someone is bringing a fish (not a mammal)
