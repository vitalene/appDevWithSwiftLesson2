//: ## Constants
//: Before finishing this playground, take a closer look at an example line of code and learn some terminology.
let numberOfDogs = 101
//: When you define a name in Swift, you are _declaring_ a name. So that line of code is known as a _declaration_. “I declare that the name numberOfDogs has the value 101!”.
//:
//: The part of the statement `= 101` is where you _assign_ the value to the name. This is called _assignment_ and the equal sign `=` is called the _assignment operator_.
//:
//: In Swift, when you declare a name using `let` you are declaring a _constant_. They are called that because the value of that name can be set only once, and cannot change after that. The value remains constant.
//:
//: In a later playground you’ll find out more about constants and their more changeable cousins, variables.
